# Prismic + Gatsby + Netlify boilerplate

I've been using Prismic and Gatsby for over 3 years now, which has enabled me to create a blog, multiple landing pages and a website with lots of traffic. I felt it was necessary to create this boilerplate project, which would enable me to create an application quickly by going through all the setup stages a little more quickly. I've also added a section on deployment via Netlify, which is quick and easy to use.

All the documentation can be found in the [Wiki section of this project](https://github.com/Estayparadox/prismic-gatsby-boilerplate/wiki).
